# Photovoltaic Solar Energy Monitoring System with Cloud Data Storage

With the constant growth of photovoltaic energy generation and the great potential of of these systems in Brazil, monitoring factors that 
may influence downfalls in generation is extremely important. This project describes a online monitoring system, storage and visualization 
of data in the cloud applied to a photovoltaic module, allowing to keep up with electricity generation, power, voltage, direct current, 
module temperature, umidity, ambient temperature, lightness and irradiance upon the module, from any location with an internet connection. 
Using the ESP32 microcontroller along with analog and digital sensors, a hardware prototype was built developed using the Arduino \ac{IDE}, 
enabling the system to collect data and send it to the AWS cloud via Wi-Fi storing it in a database and visualizing it graphically 
through the QuickSight service. Furthermore, through the SNS, AWS has allowed alerting when the module was dirty or when the 
temperature was high enough to reduce electrical generation.
